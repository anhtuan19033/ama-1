efayqueue
=========

Ask any question of anyone inside (and out) of your organisation.

We've all been there, whether you're the "new" person on the team
or you've simply forgotten why something is the way it is.
The simplest way of finding out is to ***ask***.

None of the companies we've worked at have had a decent
Frequently Asked Questions ("FAQ") system so there is a lot of
[**Tacit Knowledge**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge)

We want to fix that by building an FAQ system that is easy, quick
and intuitive to use.

## Features

- ***Search*** for keywords or entire phrases in your internal database of information

Searching is the most important feature (once there are more than a couple of pages worth of questions)

- Create a new question and target it at everyone or a specific person/group.
- Share your question on existing internal/external social networks (depending
  on the sensitivity of the question)
- Accept the reply/answer to a question if you are satisfied
- Add more detail or re-phrase a question if you are unsatisfied with an answer.
- When more than one answer is given, allow people to vote up the best answer


### Name

The name "eFAyQueue" is a working title till we come up with a better (shorter)
name. Got a suggestion? send it to us!
